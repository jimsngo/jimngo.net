                <h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">Closing Costs</h1>
                <p>This article will answer the most common questions about buyers closing costs, including some ideas
                    for minimizing paying closing costs upfront.</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: dodgerblue">Will There Always Be Closing Costs?</h2>
                <p>Yes, there are always closing costs. Whether you're the buyer or the seller or even refinancing,
                    you're going to have closing costs. If you're the buyer, your mortgage closing costs account for
                    about 2%-5% of the purchase price. If you're the seller, about 6% of the sales price will go toward
                    paying realtor fees.</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: dodgerblue">Can I Roll Closing Costs into the Loan?</h2>
                <p>Typically, the only loan that allows you to include the closing costs into the mortgage is a USDA
                    loan.</p>
                <p>Home loans have a loan-to-value ratio (LTV ratios) that puts a cap on how much you can include in the
                    loan. This is calculated by taking your loan amount plus the closing costs and then subtracting the
                    down payment. The number you're left with must not exceed the LTV limit for that specific loan.</p>
                <p>The only exception to the LTV ratio rule are USDA loans. You can include your closing costs into a
                    USDA loan just as long as your property appraises for more than the sales price.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>You can negotiate with the seller to see if and how much of your closing costs, including realtor
                        fees, they are willing to pay. One way to entice them to pay your fees is to offer to buy the
                        home for a higher purchase price if they agree to pay for some of your costs.</p>
                    <p>You may be wondering if this is actually worth, but consider this: increasing your offer by $6000
                        in exchange for them paying $6000 in your closing fees amounts to only a few extra dollars a
                        month in your mortgage payment. If you're looking for a way to save on your fees upfront, this
                        is how you want to do it.</p>
                    <p>Note that each type of loan has a max as to how much the seller can contribute to your closing
                        costs.</p>

                        generous.</p>

                        The seller and other interested parties can contribute up to 6% of the sales price or toward
                        closing costs, prepaid expenses, discount points, and other financing concessions. If the
                        appraised home value is less than the purchase price, the seller may still contribute 6% of the
                        value.</p>
                    <!-- VA Loans -------------------------------------------->
                    <p>3. <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/handbook/ChapterLendersHanbookChapter8.pdf"
                            target="_blank">VA Loan</a> - The seller may contribute up to 4% of the sale price, plus
                        reasonable and customary loan costs on VA home loans. Total contributions may exceed 4% because
                        standard closing costs do not count toward the total.</p>
                    <p>According to VA guidelines, the 4% rule only applies to items such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prepayment of property taxes and insurance</li>
                        <li>Appliances and other gifts from the builder</li>
                        <li>Discount points above 2% of the loan amount</li>
                        <li>Payoff of the buyer’s judgments and debts</li>
                        <li>Payment of the VA funding fee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, a buyer’s core closing costs for things like appraisal, loan origination, and
                        the title equal 2% of the purchase price. The seller agrees to prepay taxes, insurance, the VA
                        funding fee, and a credit card balance equal to 3% of the sales price.</p>
                    <p>This 5% contribution would be allowed because 2% is going toward the core loan closing costs.
                    </p>

                        Seller may contribute up to 6% of the sales price toward the buyer’s reasonable closing costs.
                        Guidelines also state that closing costs can’t exceed those charged by other applicants by the
                        lender for similar transactions such as FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgage loans.</p>
