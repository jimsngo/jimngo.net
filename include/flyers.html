            <div class="content slow">
                <p>If you’ve heard of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you know the family of conventional loans. These
                    loans are written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest
                    mortgage broker. “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including
                    maximum sales price.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that
                    automatically drops off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78
                    percent loan to value ratio. Also, you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income
                    ratio can be somewhat flexible as long as look really good on paper.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there
                    are now three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700
                    (better is better) and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent
                    employment, savings that can be designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit
                    report are helpful.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">FHA</button>
            <div class="content slow">
                <p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back
                    into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to
                    carefully oversee which homes can and cannot be purchased in its name.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit
                    requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet
                    or have very little, so keep that utility bill paid on time. The program allows up to six
                    percent of your closing costs to be financed into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can
                    help reduce the actual cash you need to close.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront
                    mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under
                    the current programs you’ll be forced to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the
                    loan, giving you no options but to refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s
                    costly, you want rid of it). Not every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because they can be
                    time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">VA</button>
            <div class="content slow">
                <p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA
                    loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early
                    are generally eligible, but short-term members or Reserves may have to meet additional
                    requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in
                    order to get the ball rolling with an approved lender.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely
                    nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no
                    mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding fee” that varies with your service type,
                    downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military,
                    though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">USDA</button>
            <div class="content slow">
                <p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping
                    to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be
                    located in communities with under 35,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also
                    be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and
                    other types of help are sometimes available for very low income borrowers.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be
                    approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA
                    puts in front of the building are much larger than most other programs. This is good for you,
                    because it means you’re getting a great house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and
                    can be scary for sellers. In addition, there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">The Benefits Of A 20% Down Payment</button>
            <div class="content slow">
                <p>1. Your interest rate will be lower.</p>
                <p>Putting down a 20% down payment vs. a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more
                    financially stable, thus a good credit risk. The more confident your bank is in your credit
                    score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be willing to give you.
                </p>
                <p>2. You’ll end up paying less for your home.</p>
                <p>The bigger your down payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are
                    able to pay 20% of the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction, you will only pay
                    interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the extra 15% on your loan
                    will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!</p>
                <p>3. Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</p>
                <p>In a market where many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in
                    with 20% or larger down payments. The seller gains the same confidence that the bank did above.
                    You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is more likely to be approved. Therefore, the
                    deal will be more likely to go through!</p>
                <p>4. You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</p>
                <p>Simply put, PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your
                    mortgage. It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage payment, that is required for all
                    conforming, conventional loans that have down payments less than 20%.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your monthly income</li>

                <p>When lenders review your application, they like to see consistency in your finances.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do not make major purchases like furniture, appliances, jewelry, vehicles or vacations</li>
                    <li>Don't change or quit your job</li>
                    <li>Consult with your mortgage professional before withdrawing, depositing, or moving large
                        amounts of money in or out of your bank account</li>
                    <li>Do not pay off debts or collections (unless instructed to do so by a mortgage professional)
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid using cash for a good-faith deposit - cash is difficult to verify and could result in
                        a closing delay.</li>
                    <li>Don't have your credit report pulled too many times - this can hurt your credit score</li>

            <button class="collapsible">Acceptable Sources of Cash to Close Funds</button>
            <div class="content slow">
                <p>Providing proper asset documentation and the actual source of the funds is a critical element of
                    the loan closing process.</p>
                <p>There’s nothing worse in a real estate purchase than making it all the way through the hoops and
                    hurdles just to have a loan denied after the final documents have been signed due to the
                    borrower using the wrong checking account for the down payment.</p>
                <p>Seasoning of the down payment money is just as important as the source, which is why underwriters
                    typically require at least two months bank / asset statements in the initial mortgage approval
                    process.</p>
                <p>A Few Acceptable Sources Of Down Payment Include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bank Accounts – checking / savings</li>
                    <li>Investment Accounts – money market, mutual funds</li>
                    <li>Retirement Funds – keep in mind that borrowing against a 401K plan will require a repayment,
                        which will be calculated in the Debt-to-Income Ratio</li>
                    <li>Life Insurance – Cash value and face amount</li>
                    <li>Gifts – Family members can gift down payment funds with certain restrictions</li>
                    <li>Inheritance / Trust Funds</li>
                    <li>Government Grants – Many state, county and city agencies offer special down payment
                        assistance programs.</li>
