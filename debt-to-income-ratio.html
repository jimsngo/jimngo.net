                <h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">Debt to Income Ratios</h1>
                <p>As a functioning adult, you know there’s something about debt that you’re supposed to understand at
                    this point in your life, right? Something about not having too much, or maybe not too much in
                    relation to something else… but frankly, this stuff is kind of confusing and some days you’d just
                    rather take your Visa, buy a pizza, have a massage and then take a nap.</p>
                <p>Today, though, you’re on a quest. You’ve decided it’s time to stop renting and become a homeowner.
                    You came here to get some really good information on how to do just that… so, let’s put the credit
                    card away and talk about your debt to income ratio and why it matters to your future mortgage.</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: dodgerblue">What is My Debt to Income Ratio?</h2>
                <p>If you’re not familiar with the term, don’t be shy, it’s one of the most common questions that first
                    time homebuyers have when applying for a mortgage. That’s because there aren’t a lot of places where
                    it’s obvious that your debt to income ratio is being used to determine your ability to get credit.
                    It’s sort of figured out behind the scenes and you’re none the wiser.</p>
                <p>At a very basic level, your debt to income ratio is simply what it sounds like, all your long term,
                    semi-permanent debt compared to your current income. Usually your mortgage lender will do this as a
                    monthly comparison to make it easy, but the ratio’s the same whether you compare month to month or
                    year to year. If you have $1,200 a month in debt and $5,000 a month in income, that’s the same as if
                    you had $14,400 in yearly debt and $60,000 in yearly income. Both come out to 24 percent, which is a
                    pretty good debt to income ratio.</p>
                <p>But, of course, it can’t be that easy, can it.</p>
                <p>Figuring out your debt to income ratio is just one of the very first steps you should take on your
                    path to getting a mortgage. Once you can see how much each of your debts affects your ability to get
                    a home loan, you can either refinance those debts into loans with better terms or work extra hard to
                    pay them down before approaching a mortgage lender.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>All income must be documented to have at least a two year history. If someone has only worked for one
                    and a half-years, that individual will have to wait until the two year period has passed.</p>
                <p>Documentation of the two year period means providing complete tax returns the last two years,
                    including all related forms such as W2s, 1099s, etc.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular income is verified by paycheck stubs and W2 forms.</li>
                    <li>The income reported on the forms must somewhat match up with the amounts reported on the
                        paycheck stubs. The paycheck stubs will have both regular pay listed for that pay period as well
                        as a year-to-date amount.</li>
                    <li>If you’ve recently had a change in pay, such as a raise, you’ll also need to get a statement
                        from your employer confirming that the change is permanent.</li>
                    <li>You may also be able to use special-case income, such as overtime and commissions, as part of
                        the income calculation for your mortgage. To qualify these items, you’ll need to document that
                        you’ve received them for at least two years and provide confirmation that they’re expected to
                        continue.</li>
                    <li>If this income comes from a source outside of your primary employer - such as part-time work or
                        side jobs that pay only commission - you’ll need W2 or 1099 forms to verify.</li>

                <button class="collapsible">What’s Included in a Debt to Income Ratio?</button>
                <div class="content slow">
                    <p>Things that are included in your debt to income ratio are secured loans like a car loan or a boat
                        loan, which are sort of guaranteed by the property that you’ve borrowed the money to purchase;
                        unsecured loans like credit cards and lines of credit; student loans and any debt you’ve
                        co-signed.</p>
                    <p>Let me repeat that last thing. Any debt you’ve cosigned is part of this figure. So, if you agreed
                        to cosign a loan for your sister 20 years ago and she’s still paying on it, that’s still going
                        to count against you, even though you’ve totally forgotten about it. If you’re on a joint
                        account with your ex-husband, you’re still on the hook when it comes to debt to income.</p>
                    <p>Things that aren’t included, that are almost always assumed to be, are items like your car
                        insurance, your utility bills, your cable bills, subscriptions and so forth. Basically, if you
                        can cancel the payment at will (whether or not there are serious consequences like having no
                        lights or being able to watch Game of Thrones), it’s probably not going to be included on your
                        credit report unless you fail to pay as agreed. While you’re at it, it might be a good idea to
                        go ahead and get yourself a credit report from a reputable site like MyFICO.com, the Fair Isaac
                        website, just so you can see what is actually reporting.</p>

                <div class="content slow">
                    <p>Figuring your debt to income ratio is pretty easy, the hardest part is figuring out what counts
                        and what doesn’t. Just add up your monthly expenses and divide by your monthly gross income,
                        before any taxes, insurance, 401k withdrawal and the like come out. There you go. That’s your
                        debt to income ratio. Now we can do some stuff with it!</p>
                    <p>There are three major programs that most home buyers utilize across most of the United States.
                        These are the FHA, VA and Conventional mortgages. Each has its own requirements and debt to
                        income ratio ceilings. Some are more complicated than others.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content slow">
                    <p>For FHA, there are two kinds of debt to income ratios to keep in mind. One is called the
                        front-end ratio, the other is, unoriginally, named the back-end ratio. The front-end ratio is
                        only your potential future housing debt; the back-end ratio includes all your debts. With that
                        in mind, the chart below shows how you’d look to an FHA lender as of the writing of this blog.

                    <p>The first number in the column labeled “Maximum Qualifying Ratios (%)” is the front-end ratio,
                        the second is the back-end ratio. Compensating factors can be thought of as other things you
                        bring to the table to make you into a really awesome borrower. Since you have little to no
                        experience at this mortgage thing, your FHA lender is understandably afraid of your eventually
                        missing a payment in the 30 years you’re going to have a relationship, so they want evidence to
                        show that you’re a stand-up kind of person.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">VA</button>
                <div class="content slow">
                    <p>If you’re a military vet and you’ve not used your VA mortgage benefits, you may be wondering
                        about cashing in that particular chip. When it comes to the debt to income question, it’s a
                        harder one to answer. Generally speaking, the VA wants to see a debt to income ratio below 41
                        percent, but like with other qualifiers under VA, the rules aren’t really all that hard and
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>VA loans tend to be a lot more flexible in general, and debt to income ratios are no exception.
                        Although all the loans mentioned in this blog can be manually underwritten, the guidelines only
                        allow for so much deviation outside the rules. VAs give a lot more wiggle room, so if you’re at
                        a 45 percent debt to income ratio, for example, it might not be out of the question if
                        everything else is in line.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">Conventional</button>
                <div class="content slow">
                    <p>Conventional loans are a bit easier. Fannie Mae is the principal agency that guarantees what’s
                        known as a “conventional” or “conforming” loan. Fannie has siblings like Freddie Mac and Ginnie
                        Mae, but they’re at the movies right now and we’re not going to involve them in the
                        conversation. For our purposes, conventional loans are all about Fannie Mae.</p>
                    <p>In general, conventional loans tend to be more difficult to land, in part because they have more
                        rigid income to debt requirements. For borrowers with credit scores of 680 or better and less
                        than a 25 percent down payment, Fannie won’t allow more than a 36 percent debt to income ratio
                        (but she only uses the one number, so at least it’s not more complicated than that). If your
                        credit score is above 700 and your down payment is less than 25 of the home’s price, she’ll
                        allow a 45 percent debt to income ratio.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to Fannie, bringing more money to the table will absolutely catch her eye. She
                        believes firmly that all things that glitter are definitely gold. That magic number is 25
                        percent of the sales price of your home. So, if you’re floating in cash, but have a higher debt
                        to income ratio or a little bit lower credit score, you could win brownie points this way.</p>
