                <h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">Reverse Mortgage - Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
                    (HECM)</h1>
                <p>A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan that can turn part of the equity you’ve built up in
                    your house into funds you can use today, or a line of credit that will be there when you need
                    it. Specifically designed for homeowners age 62+, it offers all the benefits of a traditional
                    line of credit that you can get from a bank but with additional benefits - including a flexible
                    repayment feature. As with any mortgage, the title to the home remains in your name, not the
                    lender’s.</p>
                <p>At a minimum, to be eligible you must be 62 years of age or older; you must have a certain
                    percentage of equity in the home; and the house must be your principal residence.</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: dodgerblue">Reverse Mortgage Advantages</h2>
                <p>A reverse mortgage has certain advantages over other types of home equity-based loans. Since a
                    HECM reverse mortgage is FHA-insured, if the loan balance ever exceeds the value of your home
                    you and your heirs are not responsible to pay the excess. As long as you satisfy your loan
                    obligations, which include maintaining your home, paying your real estate taxes, property
                    insurance and any homeowners association (HOA) fees.</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 120%; color: dodgerblue"><i>"You’ve worked hard to build the equity in your

                            <p>This option have come to be a favorite in the HECM marketplace since 2009, with about
                                67% of originated reverse mortgage loans having a fixed rate:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fixed rate will remain the same for the entire loan term, so you are protected
                                    if market rates rise.</li>
                                <li>Borrowers who choose a fixed rate reverse mortgage must take their funds as a
                                    lump sum, as opposed to other disbursement options offered at a variable rate.</li>
                                <li>When taking a lump sum, borrowers are restricted to pull only up to 60% of the
                                    principal limit of the loan.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Due to these details, fixed rate reverse mortgages are usually best for borrowers who
                                plan to use their reverse mortgage funds all at once, such as to pay off an existing
                                mortgage or other debt, or to make major home repairs or modifications.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- Variable Rate -->
                        <div id="variable-rate">
                            <p>The less popular, but oftentimes the more flexible option, is the variable rate. Just
                                as the fixed rate is “fixed” for the loan period, a variable rate varies throughout the
                                loan period. There are pros and cons to variable rate reverse mortgages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They come with more disbursement options then a fixed rate loan. Borrowers may
                                    choose between a line of credit, monthly payments, a lump sum, or a combination of
                                    the three.</li>
                                <li>Interest is only charged on funds that have been withdrawn. This means that, if
                                    you have a line of credit that you rarely use, you will only be charged interest on
                                    the amount withdrawn.</li>
                                <li>Unused lines of credit may also grow with time, allowing the borrower even more
                                    flexibility in the amount available for them to borrow.</li>
                                <li>Greater risk of your interest rate rising quickly and drastically.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In general, variable rates are best for borrowers who plan to use their reverse mortgage
                                funds over time, or in rare instances. In this way, borrowers may use it to add to their
                                existing fixed income every month, to supplement their other retirement accounts, or as
                                a stand by account so money is readily available in the case of an emergency.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>You can purchase a home by combining a one-time investment of your own funds (down
                            payment) with loan proceeds from a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) to
                            complete the transaction. As with a traditional “forward” mortgage, the home you are
                            purchasing secures the loan.</p>
                        <p>However, unlike a traditional mortgage, there are no monthly mortgage payments, which
                            can help boost your cash flow. You own the home as long as you live in it. The loan
                            does not have to be repaid until you sell the home or no longer live there as your
                            primary residence. In order for the loan to remain in good standing, you must meet certain
                            home ownership obligations - which include maintaining the property, and keeping current
                            with property-related taxes and insurance payments.</p>

                    <div class="content medium">
                        <p>A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan that’s exclusively for homeowners and homebuyers
                            age 62 and older. It allows borrowers to convert some of the equity in their home into
                            income-tax-free funds. (Not tax advice, consult a tax professional).</p>
                        <p>There are different loan products to choose from that offer you options on what interest rate
                            you are charged, how much money you can access, and how you receive your payments. Unlike a
                            regular “forward” mortgage or traditional home equity loan or home equity line of credit,
                            there are no monthly principal and interest payments as long as at least one of the
                            borrowers lives in the home as their primary residence.</p>
                        <p>As with any mortgage, in order for the loan to remain in good standing the borrower must also
                            keep up with property-related taxes, insurance and upkeep.</p>

                            <ul>

                                <li>The home must be your principal residence. And it must meet standards set by the

                                    condition. You may be able to use your reverse mortgage to pay for any required

                                <li>Eligible property types include single-family homes, 2- to 4-unit properties,
                                    manufactured homes meeting certain criteria, condominiums that are approved by the

                        <p>A reverse mortgage offers certain advantages:

                                <li>With a traditional home equity loan or home equity line of credit, you must make
                                    monthly principal and interest payments on the balance while you live in the home -
                                    with a reverse mortgage, you don't. Your reverse mortgage balance, including accrued
                                    interest and fees, does not have to be repaid until you sell the home or permanently
                                    leave the home, as long as you meet your loan obligations (which includes keeping
                                    current with property-related taxes, insurance and upkeep).</li>
                                <li>With a reverse mortgage line of credit, the unused amount in your credit line
                                    actually grows over time - giving you access to more available funds. This means
                                    that the less you take out up front, the more will be available to you later.</li>
                                <li>And the lender cannot “freeze” or reduce the line of credit, as long as you fulfill
                                    your loan obligations - so it will be there if and when you need it.</li>

                        <p>Typically, reverse mortgage loan funds are not subject to income tax. Contact your tax

                    <div class="content fast">
                        <p>The funds from a reverse mortgage generally do not affect regular Social Security or Medicare
                            benefits. However, needs-based benefits, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income
                            (SSI), may be impacted. One of our licensed reverse mortgage specialists can provide
                            additional general information, but you should contact a financial professional or
                            government benefits specialist about your particular situation.</p>

                        <p>Use the proceeds for the things you need and want. For example: establishing a “rainy day”
                            fund for the unexpected, paying monthly bills, making home improvements, paying for health
                            care, covering the cost of in-home services, making a major purchase such as a new vehicle,
                            and more.</p>

                    <div class="content fast">
                        <p>Yes, with the HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) For Purchase loan, qualified borrowers
                            can use their loan proceeds to buy a home that better suits their needs and lifestyle. It’s
                            a home financing option that can make it easier for buyers age 62 and older to afford the
                            home they want, while preserving more of their savings.</p>

                    <div class="content fast">
                        <p>Reverse mortgages are available with either fixed or variable rates. Borrowers who elect a
                            fixed-rate loan will receive their funds as a single disbursement lump sum. A lump sum
                            disbursement is also available with an adjustable rate. A line of credit and monthly
                            advances have an adjustable rate.</p>

                    <div class="content fast">
                        <p>Yes, refinancing is possible. This option may be to your advantage if your home increases in
                            value, making more funds available.</p>

                    <button class="collapsible">Will I have to pay any fees?</button>
                    <div class="content fast">
                        <p>With the exception of a fee for government-required reverse mortgage counseling, most of the
                            fees associated with a reverse mortgage can be financed with your loan, so there’s no
                            immediate out-of-pocket cost. The costs are added to the loan amount (“principal”) and paid
                            along with the accrued interest when the loan becomes due. Depending on the loan option you
                            choose, these fees may include an origination fee, closing costs, a mortgage insurance
                            premium (required for HECM loans) and a monthly servicing fee. Ask us about our “Low-Cost
                            HECM” pricing option, which eliminates nearly all origination and closing costs.</p>

                        <p>You’ll repay the loan balance, any fees that have been added, and the accrued interest.
                            Homeowners (or their heirs) usually choose to do this through the sale of the home or other
                            assets. Repaying the loan by refinancing through a conventional mortgage is also an option.
