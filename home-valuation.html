					<h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">What Is My Home Worth?</h1>
					<p>Home values are determined through a complicated series of calculations roughly based on the cost
						of actual construction plus value-adds like proximity to shopping and other conveniences. The
						prices that other nearby homes have sold for in the past are also taken into consideration.
						Formulas are applied, mysterious algorithms are run. In short, home valuation is magic and
						appraisers are all wizards. </p>
					<p>Real estate is also very personal and emotional. Two houses with the same floor plan, but
						different shades of brick or different trees in the front yard can have different values to the
						person doing the buying.</p>
					<p>With today's technology, homeowners and buyers across the country can easily go online and search
						for the value of their homes or a home they're considering buying. Please keep in mind that it
						is only an estimate, a general idea about the value of the home. The only way to know a home’s
						actual value is to reach out to a professional home appraiser for his or her formal opinion, and
						then ultimately, a home is only worth what the market will bear and what a buyer will give. So
						again, how do you find this magic number?</p>
					<p>Below are my suggestions:</p>

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Real estate agents specialize in answering the question "what is my home worth?" for
							their clients, which they do by running a comparative market analysis. This process
							involves finding similar properties (“comps”) that sold within the past 90 days. The
							most accurate comp is a home that’s nearby, similar to yours in square footage, and
							has the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms. (Ideally, the lot size is also
							equivalent, but that's more important in rural areas, where homes are set on
							multiple acres.) Once your agent finds a few recently sold comps, then she averages
							the purchase prices and uses that figure as a baseline for how much your home is
							worth.</p>

			<button class="collapsible">What Is My Home Worth to A Buyer?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Sellers need to consider how home buyers search for properties online. Let’s assume your home's fair
					market value is $503,000.Yet Dossman points out that many people search for homes on the web using
					$20,000 or $25,000 increments. The upshot? Listing your home for $503,000 could prevent your listing
					from being seen by buyers who are searching for homes in the $475,000 to $500,000 bracket, so
					knocking off $3,000 for an asking price of $500,000 might generate more traffic—and maybe even a
					bidding war to push that price above your expectations.</p>
				<p>Also, avoid listing your home at an odd dollar figure (e.g., $999,000 instead of $1 million). While
					retailers and as-seen-on-TV purveyors of the Miracle Mop effectively price products ending in $0.95
					or $0.99, Dossman says the same approach doesn’t apply to real estate: “It’s hard to justify awkward
					pricing. It’s just confusing to buyers.”</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Your Neighborhood</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>“You should always look at what other properties are listed for in your community,” says Chris
					Dossman, a real estate agent with Century 21 Scheetz in Indianapolis. For instance, “if your
					neighbor’s home is listed for $400,000 and you want to list yours at $500,000, you'd better be able
					to clearly explain the price difference to prospective buyers." Or else adjust your price
					accordingly.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Try to Remain Objective</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>“Sellers always think that their home is worth more than it is, because of their personal
					attachment,” says Dossman. Indeed, it’s hard to boil down years or decades of memories in a home to
					a number. It's also hard to accept that your home is worth less than what you paid for it, or that
					you can't just tack on the price of the renovations you've made. On average, renovations will reap
					you only a 64% return on investment, although that varies based on the type of upgrades you've made.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Why It's Important to Price Your Home Right</button>
			<div class="content flex-perfect-center slow">
				<div class="col-8 col-s-8">
					<p>Price your home too high, and it could wind up sitting on the market. That’s a big problem,
						because a property that goes unsold for an extended period of time (e.g., more than 30 days)
						often becomes stigmatized.</p>
					<p>“Buyers get suspicious when they see a house that’s been on the market for a while,” says
						Dossman. “They think that something is wrong with the home.” If that’s the case, the seller may
						have to make a significant price reduction—sometimes dropping the price below market value—in
						order to nab a buyer.
					</p>
					<p>Pricing your home below market value in an attempt to stir interest and generate multiple bids
						can also backfire. Granted, the strategy that could work in a hot seller’s market, but
						underpricing your home frequently leads buyers to assume that your home is worth only its list
						price, says Dossman.</p>
					<p>Your best bet: Know what your home is worth and list your home close to that figure—aka its
						market value. When in doubt, turn to your real estate agent to help you cut through the haze and
						help you pinpoint the right price.</p>

			<button class="collapsible" id="tip_4">10 Reasons Why Your Home Isn't Selling</button>
			<div class="content slow">
				<p>The waiting game isn’t a fun a game to play - especially when it comes to selling your home. You’ve
					put your house up on the market. Yet, you haven’t had one single offer. So, what’s going on? There
					are a variety of reasons why your home isn’t selling. Forewarning: You might need to make a few
					adjustments.</p>
				<p>Here are the top 10 reasons why your home isn’t selling (and don’t worry, most of them are fixable!).
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>You Lack Marketing</h4>
						<p>“If we build it, they will come.” This doesn’t prove true for many new (and sometimes,
							useful!) products. And same goes for when you put your home up for sale. Just putting it up
							on the market isn’t enough. You need to post your listing in as many places as possible.
							Most of these places are online. Online is the first place potential buyers check out.</p>
						<p>Real estate agents can also be great resources for this. If you haven’t hire one, think about
							it. If you have, make sure they are doing their job. Ask questions regarding where your
							house is listed. And if they aren’t doing a good job, it might prove best to switch agents -
							Find someone that knows what they are doing and has ample experience.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your House is Priced Too High</h4>
						<p>This is a common mistake. Too high of a price won’t exactly woe any buyers. It can deter
							people from even viewing your home - It’s not in their budget. And it may be obvious that
							the home isn’t worth the price tag. You should do your market research before determining a
							price for your home. Compare your home to others currently on the market. Again, a real
							estate agent can help you out with this!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Home is In Serious Need of Repairs</h4>
						<p>A lot of people don’t want to buy a home that needs work. It isn’t ideal. So, what can you
							do? You could have someone come in and do a pre-listing inspection. From there, fix the
							problems. It will help you sell your house faster.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Home Isn’t Prepared For Showings</h4>
						<p>That first impression matters! If you haven’t done it yet, get an expert to set up or make
							suggestions to switch things up so your house shows better. You might have to move furniture
							around. But it is entirely worth it.</p>
						<p>Other ways to make your house show worthy? Make sure it is tidy and clean. If you have pets,
							clean up after them. Pay attention to the temperature. If it’s winter, make sure it feels
							warm and inviting. If it’s summer, make sure you have the A/C on and working.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Location is Anything But Ideal</h4>
						<p>This is a tough one to fix. If the location isn’t exactly sought-after, be prepared to play
							the waiting game. It might just take more time to find that perfect buyer.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>It Smells</h4>
						<p>We get used to the smell of our own home. And unfortunately, it can be hard to detect. Some
							of the most common odors that throw buyers off include cigarettes, pets, food, and moisture.
							Do a smell test. Have a friend or neighbour come by to make sure you are good to go.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Bad Timing</h4>
						<p>In real estate, there is a good time to sell and a bad time to sell. If the market isn’t
							looking good to sell, it may be best to wait (and there are tons of reasons that this may be
							the case). Do your research. Ask your local real estate agent. Find the right time for your
							area and location.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>The Local Market is Working Against You</h4>
						<p>It’s not just timing you have to worry about. Are a lot of people selling around you? Is it a
							buyers market in your area? That might be why your home isn’t selling. Again, your real
							estate agent should be able to point you in the right direction for this one. The time of
							year plus the number of houses on sale play a huge role in whether your house sells or not.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>You Hired The Wrong Real Estate Agent</h4>
						<p>This can be a major problem. You want someone with experience, who is reliable, and knows the
							market. Make sure you take your time choosing your real estate agent. It’s okay to meet with
							a few before selecting yours.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>You Aren’t Flexible</h4>
						<p>You stand your ground on your asking price. But everyone is putting in offers that are lower.
							You don’t bother with repairs even though it’s the main reason your home inspection fell
							through. These could potentially be reasons why your home isn’t selling. Get those repairs
							done. Be flexible and realistic when it comes to pricing and offers. Or else yes, it will
							take a lot more time for your house to sell.</p>
						<p>Go through the above reasons and be honest with yourself. Determine why your home isn’t
							selling - then, find ways to fix the problem. Or at least come to terms with it. Don’t make
							selling your home more of a hassle or process than it has to be.</p>
