			<button class="collapsible">A short sale is an option if:</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<ul>
					<li>You are ineligible to refinance or modify your mortgage</li>
					<li>You are facing a long-term hardship</li>
					<li>You are behind on your mortgage payments</li>
					<li>You owe more on your home than it's worth</li>
					<li>You have not been able to sell your home at a price that covers what you still owe on your

					<li>You can no longer afford your home and are ready or need to leave</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">What is a short sale?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>A short sale is one alternative to foreclosure. In a short sale, the home owner, real estate
					professional, and lender work together to form an agreement to sell a home at current market
					value; this agreed upon value is typically below the existing balance on the home owner’s
					mortgage. The property is able to transfer hands to a new owner, removing the overhead and risk
					from the lender’s portfolio and relieving the existing home owner of the burden of an underwater
					mortgage. The short sale process can prove challenging, stressful, and time consuming; it
					requires persistence and dedication.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Why use an SFR®?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Members of the National Association of REALTORS® who have earned the Short Sales and Foreclosure
					Resource certification understand distressed property transactions, and everything that is
					included.</p>
				<p>Working with an SFR® takes the stress out of distressed property transactions. We know that
					selling or buying a home in uncertain times can be scary, but we know how to make it happen.
					With unexpected opportunities everywhere, now is the time to sell or buy.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 col-s-4">
			<button class="collapsible">Price</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>The price you offer to the seller of a short-sale property should reflect what’s termed fair
					market value. Fair market value is the price a buyer will pay and a seller will accept for a
					property under reasonable and ordinary conditions. We will provide with a comparative market
					analysis (CMA) that includes listings of comparable properties that have sold in the last 6
					months as well as pending listings so that you can make an informed decision on how much to
					offer. However, please note that the listing price of the short-sale property may or may not
					reflect market value.</p>
				<p>Some short-sale properties are priced extremely aggressively with the goal of creating a bidding
					war, which may still backfire if the offer accepted by the seller is not approved by the lender.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Length of Time for Approval</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>Each lender has its own protocol for approving short sales. We will need to allow a sufficient
					amount of time in the contract to assure both the seller and the seller’s lender that they are
					not wasting their time with your offer.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Earnest Money</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>This deposit at time of contract indicates to the seller that you are acting in good faith and
					will attempt to satisfy all contingencies within your control within the time frames agreed to
					in the contract. It also shows the lender that your contract has a reasonable chance of closing.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 col-s-4">
			<button class="collapsible">Home Inspection</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Most short sales are sold “as is.” All buyers should complete a home inspection. The purpose of
					the home inspection is to determine, based upon condition, if the property is acceptable on the
					terms offered to the seller. You will want to complete a home inspection within a few days
					following the signing of the contract. You should not wait to complete the home inspection until
					after the contract is approved because you may possibly waste months in a contract that ends up
					failing because of property condition.</p>
				<p>If the inspection report alerts you to defects prior to the seller’s lender receiving the
					contract, you may be able to renegotiate terms with the seller based upon the defects.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Mortgage Application</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Frequently, seller’s lenders give limited time to close after approval and if you have not
					started your mortgage process, you will not be able to meet the required date for closing.
					Often, buyer’s lenders are reluctant to order the appraisal prior to approval by the seller’s
					lender. Although an appraisal will need to be updated if more than six months had passed, many
					buyers have found that ordering it and possibly paying for an update have saved them money since
					the appraisal done by their mortgage lender was a major influence on the seller’s lender when
					the seller’s lender expected to negotiate a higher sales price than what was offered. This is
					your decision and you need to instruct your lender on how you want to proceed.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Attorney Modification</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>If there is an attorney modification clause in the contract being used you will want your
					attorney to look over the contract and make modifications within the time frame allotted
					starting from the signing of the contract by you and the seller—not from the time the lender
					approves it. Whatever time frame is agreed to must be provided for both sides, and allowing a
					seller to get out of the contract after it is approved by the lender puts you in jeopardy. As a
					reminder, it is important that you choose an attorney who understands the short-sale process.
